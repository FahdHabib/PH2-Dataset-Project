# PH2-Dataset-Project
The PH2 Dataset is a dermoscopic image database. I wrote a MATLAB/Octave function that could perform Skin Lesion segmentation from Dermoscopic Images and evaluate the results. Evaluation details are as follows:-

You have to test your algorithm on all images given in dataset PH2 using performance parameters given below. Different performance parameters are used to evaluate the robustness of segmentation algorithms.

Here, True positive rate (TPR) is the fraction of number of true positive (pixels that actually belong to vessels) and total number of vessel pixels in the retinal image and false positive rate (FPR) is calculated by dividing false positives (pixels that donâ€™t belong to vessels) by total number of non-vessel pixels in the retinal image. Find out sensitivity and specificity values for all algorithms. Another parameter which is used for evaluation of segmentation algorithms is dice coefficient. 

Make a table for whole dataset mentioning each image with respective performance parameter values and average values in last row of table.
